\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Whilst travelling I was introduced to Sirs Bertrand, Igor, and\
Small, who had been arguing for some time. Sir Bertrand pulled me\
aside and whispered "Sir Igor is a Knave!" That same night,\
over dinner, Sir Igor claimed "Sir Small is a Knave." Sir\
Small was present and disagreed: "Sir Igor and I are Knights!"\
