Let us really be systematic!

"Sir Emma, I and Sir Lillian are Knights," said Sir Sofia. "I, Sir Sofia and Sir Natalie are Knights," said Sir Lillian. "Sir Lillian, Sir Claire and I are Knights," said Sir Natalie. "Sir Natalie, Sir Claire and Sir Allison are Knights," said Sir Claire.

Sir Elise said: "Sir Esther or I is a Knight." Sir Esther said: "I or Sir Lauren is a Knight." Sir Lauren said: "Sir Isabel or Sir Lauren is a Knight." Sir Isabel said: "Sir Margaret or Sir Elise is a Knight."

Let us not forget Sir Allison, who claimed that "at least one of us is a Knight" at some point. Sir Isabel said the opposite, namely, that "all of us are Knaves."

What about Sir Claire, who asserted: "exactly one of Sir Margaret, I and  Sir Isabel is a Knight" with great confidence? And what about Sir Lauren, who asserted: "exactly one of I, Sir Sofia, Sir Natalie and Sir Margaret is a Knave" also with great confidence?

That is  not  all. There is  more.

There is Sir Claire who told everyone that "at most one of Sir Natalie, Sir Margaret and Sir Elise is a Knight."



That still was not quite systematic, but there could be a unique solution.
