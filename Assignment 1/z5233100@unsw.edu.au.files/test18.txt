"Sir Camille, Sir Rosali and I are Knights," said Sir Jeanie. Sir Rifka told everyone that "at least one of Sir Camille, Sir Jeannie, Sir Deylan and Sir Rifka is a Knave." It was such a beautiful day. There were lots of people outside. Sir Thorsten in particular was enjoying the sun. I could also see Sir Deylan who told us that "all of us are Knaves" which sounded suspicious to me.

A few days went by. The weather became awful. "Exactly one of Sir Rosali, Sir Jeannie, Sir Jado and Sir Meryn is a Knight" was I heard Sir Rifka say.

I think I forgot to tell you about Sir Jado as well as Sir Neil. Both actually said nothing. That is fine. Everything is so confusing. Oh, by the way, "I am a Knight" said Sir Thorsten, but we know anyone can say that for sure!
