When Sir Elizabeth, you know, the good friend of mine,
told me: "I or Sir Peter is a Knight,"
I was very confused. This became worse when Sir Peter replied:
"exactly one of us is a Knave." And even worse when Sir
Simon added: "at most one of us is a Knave."
And still even worse when Sir Elizabeth finally said: "Sir Simon is a Knight."

Are these guys Knights or Knaves?
