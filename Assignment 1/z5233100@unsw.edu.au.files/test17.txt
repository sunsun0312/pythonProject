Sir Camila goes for a walk with Sir Madeline on Mondays. On Tuesdays, Sir Camila goes for a walk with Sirs Fiona and Maggie. All know Sir Josie very well. On a Sunday, Sir Juliet said: "at least one of us is a Knight."

On a Saturday, it happened that "at least one of us is a Knave" was claimed by Sir Fiona. "Sir Annabelle and I are Knaves," asserted Sir Josie. As for Sir Jessica, it did not take her long to admit that "Sir Jessica, Sir Carol or Sir Annabelle is a Knight" on a Thursday.

"I am a Knight," shouted Sir Maggie last Wednesday!

It remains to be seen who is what, and in particular, whether Sir Camila tells the truth or not.
