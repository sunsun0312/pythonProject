Let us opt for something more systematic!

"Sir Grace, I and Sir Hannah are Knaves" said Sir Penelope. Fine. Did not Sir Otto say that "at least one of us is a Knight?" I think so.

Also, Sir Otto considently asserted that "Sir Lydia, Sir Otto, Sir Mohammed, Sir Hannah or Sir Nixon is a Knave."

"I, Sir Cassius, Sir Corey and Sir Grace is a Knight" was claimed by Sir Sarah.

"All of us are Knights" was probably wrong, but that is what Sir Cassius claimed.

Well, there was nothing systematic there. I think there are quite a few solutions, and Sir Grace agrees.
